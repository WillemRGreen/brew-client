                        A V60 is a percolation method of brewing, which means that it is based on the water dripping through the ground coffee, instead of soaking in it.

                        You'll have to wet the filter inside the V60, and add the grounds. Then you'll want to make a "bloom" with the coffee by adding the weight of the coffee's worth in water and waiting 30 seconds before adding any more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once 30 seconds pass, add water up to 200g. After that point, just add 50g every 15 seconds until you have reached your projected brew weight. If you need help calculating your weights for the brew, just find the weight of how much coffee you want to make. Then divide that number by your preferred ratio to get your input weight. The brewing algorithm will do that automatically as long as you know how much coffee you want to make.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After you've reached your projected brew weight, give the "slurry" a gentle stir. This will dislodge any grounds sticking to the sides of the filter. Then let the water drip down until the drips from the V60 are roughly three seconds apart. Then you can dispose of your filter and enjoy your coffee!
