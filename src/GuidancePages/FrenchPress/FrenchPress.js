                    A French Press is an immersion method of brewing, which means that it steeps watr and grounds like tea, as opposed to percolation where the water just drips through the grounds.

                    Brewing with a french press is super easy, all you have to do is prepare the appropriate amount of coffeeand hot water. Then fill the french press with the ground coffee and water, then wait until the coffee naturally filters down to the bottom of the brewer.

                    Once the coffee has filtered down, you'll use the the french press filter to push down until it naturally stops. Then just pour!
