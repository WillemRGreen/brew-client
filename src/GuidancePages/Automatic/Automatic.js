                    To state the obvious, any automatic method is going to be the easiest way to brew coffee. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, there are still some things you can do to elevate your automatic brews.

                <p>
                    The best things you can do are in the preparation.

                <p>
                    First, you'll want to start with good water. Anything filtered should be relatively fine, just don't use tap water. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, make sure you have a way of grinding your coffee yourself, instead of buying it pre-ground. Most grinders will do just fine, but you'll want to avoid a bladde grinder if you can, and go for a burr grinder instead. The idea here is the consistent size of the grind pieces. A burr grinder will only allow the pieces through if they are a certain size, as opposed to a blade grinder which chops the beans randomly.

                <p>
                    Then, just try your brew and adjust the grind according to your taste preferences.
