                    There are two methods for brewing an aeropress, standard and inverted. This guide will cover the inverted method.

                    An aeropress is a super popular way to brew coffee. Its very portable, very quick, and relatively easy to get right.

                    The key to brewing an aeropress well is to remember that it shouldnt take too long. Aeropress is a mixture of percolation and immersion brewing, which means that it has two stages of brewing, a "steeping" stage, and a drip stage. The inital stage should take about a minute with the water in the aeropress, and then another minute to slowly push the coffee out via the top of the aeropress.

                    The basic steps of making an inverted aeropress are to first put the filter in the aeropress, then invert the connected pieces and add the ground coffee. Then, with heated water to about 195 degrees, add up to the ratio for this particular brew.

                    After one minute, place your cup or carafe over the open top of the aeropress and invert it, then gently press the aeropress down until you hear a hissing sound. The hiss is the air escaping the filter which means that the coffee has made it through and you should stop pressing.
